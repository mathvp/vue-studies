# pokemon-info

A simple application to learn Vue.js.

It just GETs the 1st generation Pokemon info from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and list them. The results can be filtered by Pokemon name. I used Vue.js [Computed Properties](https://it.vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html) for this.
