# VueJS lessons

A repository for all of my projects with Vue while I'm learning it.

## Projects List

- ### [Pok√©mon Info v2](https://github.com/mathvp/vue-studies/tree/master/pokemon-v2)
It gets the Pokemon info data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with Axios and shows to the user.
In this version you can check more pokemon details than v1, each *creature* has it own detail page.
Each detail page shows the pokemon picture with a custom background color, based on its type, Grass pokemons has green backgrounds, flying type has a blue one, etc.
